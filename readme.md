# Image Classification on wild Animals Dataset

This repository contains code and blog on how to build a Image Classifier on Wild Animal Dataset in python. In this project, I have experimented with various machine learning and Deep learning Algorithms and compared their performance. 

## Dataset

The Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/wild-animals-images). You need a Kaggle account to download the dataset. The dataset contains wild animal images of 6 different species. Download them into a directory named `wild_animals_images` in the current directory.

## Dependencies

Install required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

code is in the form of jupyter notebook. You can run the notebook using the following command:

    jupyter notebook

It will open the jupyter notebook in your browser. You can run the code cells in the notebook.

All the visualizations will be saved into a directory called `visualizations` in the current directory.

Trained Models will be saved into a directory called `models` in the current directory.


## Blog

You can read the blog on this project [here](Image_Classification-Wild_Animal_Dataset.pdf).
